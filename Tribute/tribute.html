        <p class="Paragraph"><b>Michel de Nostredame</b> (depending on the source, <b>14 or 21 December 1503 – 1 or 2
                July 1566</b>), usually Latinised as <b>Nostradamus</b>,[a] was a French astrologer, physician and
            reputed seer, who is best known for his book Les Prophéties, a collection of 942 poetic quatrains[b]
            allegedly predicting future events. The book was first published in 1555.

            <br>Nostradamus's father's family had originally been Jewish, but had converted to Catholic Christianity a
            generation before he was born. He studied at the University of Avignon, but was forced to leave after just
            over a year when the university closed due to an outbreak of the plague. He worked as an apothecary for
            several years before entering the University of Montpellier, hoping to earn a doctorate, but was almost
            immediately expelled after his work as an apothecary (a manual trade forbidden by university statutes) was
            discovered. He first married in 1531, but his wife and two children died in 1534 during another plague
            outbreak. He fought alongside doctors against the plague before remarrying to Anne Ponsarde, with whom he
            had six children.
